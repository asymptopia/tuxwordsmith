========================
TuxWordSmith-0.6.5
========================
July 7, 2008

1. English-Chinese ... Play in English, Definitions in Chinese (Traditional, Simple, Pinyin)
	This is the main feature of this release.
	
2. 21 new dictionary resources created by inverting existing dictionaries. Some are sparse,
	like Thai-English, English-Swahili, etc ... but interesting for novelty.  Others are very
	complete.  Most have about 1000-3000 words, some have over 50,000 words.  More documentation
	on statistics will appear in the near(?) future...  
	
3. English-German and English-Russian full dictionaries also added. 
	These are not created by inverting existing resources, and so are very complete.

New Resources:

Albanian-English
English-Basque

English-Czech

========================
TuxWordSmith-0.6.4
========================
May 1, 2008

1. Window manager close button can now be used to close the application. No other changes.

========================
TuxWordSmith-0.6.3
========================
April 26, 2008

1. The download has been split into 2 separate downloads: One for the application and default 
French-English dictionary, and one for the other 40+ languages. French-English was chosen as 
the default because of it was of reasonable size, realatively complete, and demonstrates the
use of special characters.  The splitting was done to free-up bandwidth on the author's server.
Both the application and add-ons come with installers for Lin/Mac/Win, so there should be no
problems.  Just follow the instructions and install the application before the add-ons.

========================
TuxWordSmith-0.6.2
========================
April 18, 2008

1. Small bug fix: When the user has dragged a tile to the board and presses F5 to shuffle, the
game throws the tiles back to the tray and shuffles them, as it should.  However, the call
"self.submissionspots.empty()" should also have been performed afterwards to clear-out the board
spots.  The result was that when the user next attempted to submit a word for validation, some
"submissionspots" were still set as "occupied", when, in fact, they were not, thus leading to a 
crash!  This has been fixed. 

========================
TuxWordSmith-0.6.1
========================
April 16, 2008

1. The game now maintains a persistent copy of the reference throughout the session, such that
lookup times are essentially instant. 

2. The dictionary parser has been rewritten to eliminate abbreviations and several other "unfair"
entries previously played by Tux.

3. Behavior at game start-up has been changed: Previously there was a long pause while the
game took inventory of the available dictionary resources.  Then it launched into "demo" mode
automatically.  Thus, if game was already configured and user merely wanted to play, they would
have to endure 2x long pauses -- 1 before going into demo mode, and 2 after pushing the "play"
button from within demo mode.  This has now been changed as follows: The old fireworks show/screen-
saver has been reintroduced, along with 3 buttons: [Demo, Play, Admin]. Now the fireworks proceed
until user chooses a button.  In case the user wants the demo mode to play endless scrabble, ie
start a new game (as opposed to reverting to fireworks screensaver) then there has been a toggle
added in the Admin panel ("SCREENSAVER_ON" -- default=True) which can be turned-off to achieve 
this.  Overall, it should be more pleasant to use, since now you can go direct to game/demo/admin.

4. The validation rules for interactive play had a logic bug that was much too restrictive.  As a
result, adding "b" to "oil", for example, was not allowed. This was obviously not intended and has
been fixed.  Also, wrapping an existing submission was resulting in intermediate letters not being
added to the submission.  Rather significant bugs! These avoided detection, however, because the
computer player does not use the same validation code, and most of the debugging was done while
watching computer vs. computer.   

5. Webster's Collegiate dictionary (2003) replaced old Webster's (1913).

6. F8 (Skip and exchange all tiles) had a bug whereby tiles were indeed thrown back to the bag-of-tiles,
only to be redrawn. Now they are inserted at random positions within the bag-of-tiles (vs. appended)
so that you really do get a new set of tiles now.

7. Feedback info is written to the screen when loading and analyzing the configured dictionary resource.

NOTE: Please send bug reports to ccosse@gmail.com so bugs can get fixed!

======================
TuxWordSmith-0.6.0-rc1
======================

In TMS tiles are drawn from a flat distribution, and can thus be drawn on-the-fly. In TWS, however,
the letter distributions are not flat (they are computed based on frequency-of-occurance of each
character in the dictionary resource) and thus we maintain a "bag of tiles" containing the correct
relative numbers of character.

Any time a player elects to skip a turn, all tiles are automatically swapped and the counter which
counts the number of consecutive skips is incremented, 

NEED:
 - Salvage of words, esp in Greek-English
 - Overlay unicode support
 - Overlay distribution (have that func somewhere...)
 - Combobox selection in admin
 - check for STOP_RUNNING in mkidxfingerprint

The AAA-Oxford-English dictionary should be sufficient for use by kids (assuming kids use basic words).

Left-click on locked words for definition overlay.
Right-click on tiles for tile info. 
F1 to clear definition area

Select the dictionary resource from the combobox list widget in the Admin panel. Don't forget to save
your selection!
